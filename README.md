# Guess-Number
### This simple project demonstrates how easy it is to manipulate CSS and HTML using a Java Script.

This is a web game. The player must guess the number without spending all the points.
If a player spends all the points he loses. The number of points is the number of attempts.
The best attempts to guess the number will be counted as the best points.
